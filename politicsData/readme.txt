This directory is used to manipulate and clean the csv files. 
Liberals.csv and Republicans.csv are cleaned using parseRepublicans.sh and parseLiberals.sh shell scripts.
The shell scrips will make a file called liberalsTableClean.txt or republicanTableClean.txt which are delimited with three percent signs.

The fields for these are: party, createdUtc, score, domain, title, author, ups, downs, numComments, permaLinks, selfText, thumbNail, urlImg
