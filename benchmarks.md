  95%   |2858 
  98%   |2973 
  99%   |2984 
 100%   |2984 (longest request) 


For this test there was a lot of latency, and we saw that in the table above, 50% and above requests were served with greater than 2500 ms latency
which is too high for the user. Since all these percentages had close to 2500ms of time, we can conclude that ALL requests took a similar amount of time.
For the next two tests i wont bother going any higher because I know that we already reached an unbearable amount of load.
Also, this machine is running on a single core CPU, with 512 mb of ram, so it is not optimized for high loads

Since the program is failing at such a low number of requests it indicates to me that it has to be the low performant hardware. If we try to increase the hardware specs
and we still obtain bad results, then we can conclude that it is a software problem.
To fix this problem we need to get more CPU power 

 

##Second test, 200 requests, 1 concurrent

```ab -n 200 -c 1 127.0.0.1:5000/politics/    ```

From the last test we saw that a concurrency of 10 wrecked the server, and the latency was too high. So I decided to take a step back and see 
if the server could endure one request at a time, but for a long time, so i decided to do 200 requests at 1 concurrency. We found that the server
gave us a maximum of 556 ms for a request, and that in general, we got 237ms response time, which is pretty decent. This means that the server can handle light traffic without any problems.
This server can probably endure a large number of requests, but not concurrently. It has a lot of endurance, but no real muscular power.
